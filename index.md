# Hello world!

## Pr√©sentation

My name is Hakan and I'm a junior software engineer.

I began to take an interest in programming at the age of 14.
I started by learning the C language on [openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/).
Now, my favorite areas are algorithmic and web development.
Apart from new technologies, I like playing soccer, reading mangas
and playing video games.

On this website, you can find some of my works which I've done on my personal time.
I'll be very happy to receive your feedback, so don't hesitate to contact me.
